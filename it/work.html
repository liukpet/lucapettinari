        My working experience began in late 2018 at <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.audeering.com/">audEERING</a> (nearby Munich, Bayern), a thriving start-up born as a spin-off of <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.tum.de/en/">TUM</a> and nowadays leader in the fields of emotion recognition and paralinguistic analysis.
        I started with a 3 months internship thanks to the <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/node_en">ERASMUS+ Traineeship program</a>, which to join the company to develop my thesis project, which encompassed interdisciplinary fields like biomedical engineering, electronics and computational intelligence.
        In this first span of time, I was lucky enough to see this company funded by a bunch extremely talented guys growing up (and still does!) at tremendous rate, with people coming from all Europe and beyond. My duties were mainly related to set the stage
        for collecting data for my thesis project, whose one of the purposes was to correlate subtle variations in audio signals with a physiological parameter, the heart rate. My skills in electronics revealed to be incredibly helpful
        since I had to assemble from scratch a working device to collect such audio and heart rate data. In particular, heart-rate data where derived by electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, thus my background in biomedical engineering was vital in orded to deal
        with such physiological signals. I was supported by an amazing team, with people contributing to my project with terrific advices and insights that no "stack-overflowish" website could ever possibly give. Many of them were actually those who I
        hanged out with in Munich during summer's weekends, and I think we were more of a big family than mere employees.

        After the internship, I was hired for other six months as Junior AI Researcher: in addition to proceed with my thesis, I was assigned also with another project, involving the recording of chewing sounds and heart rate
        of children while eating different kind of foods. The goal of the project was to investigate possible connections between heating disorders related to overweight and obesity and chewing sound patterns. For this project, the user interface to collect data was particularly curated, as to be user-friendly and entertaining as possible.
        The initiative was welcome with unexpected enthusiasm and partecipation from both families and children of the NÃ¶rdlingen's Grundschule, and raised also the interest of the local daily (<a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/noerdlingen/Noerdlinger-Grundschueler-knuspern-fuer-die-Wissenschaft-id52967221.html">click here</a> to learn more).
        The technology developed for that occasion was fused to the already existing recording equipment I built during the first three months, and the result was a completely working acquisition system (both hardware and partecipant-interface) to obtain a dataset, complete of subject annotations, of synchronized audio-ECG signals to study the effects of raised pulse on voice recordings.
        The final goal was to estimate heart rate from audio recordings using an AI approach, hence the ECG recordings provided the right labels for the audio segments that were used to fit a supervised learning model with promising results.

        Briefly after the experience in Germany, I graduated in Biomedical Engineer at <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.univpm.it/Entra/">UNIVPM</a>, Italy (see the <a class="hl-link-work" href="education.html">Education</a> section for more). Later on, I had a short experience into another grown-up startup, <a class="hl-link-work" href="http://www.civitanavi.com/">Civitanavi Systems</a>, which is a market leader (with few others throughout the country)
        in manufactoring of inertial measurement units (IMUs) based on fiber optic technology. I was hired as Manufactoring Test Engineer, with main task of sanity-checking data from tested IMUs and support of the development and implementation of algorithms to automate the process. Then, thanks to <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.dii.univpm.it/stefano.squartini">Prof. Squartini</a>, who was my thesis supervisor during the period abroad, I had
        the opportunity to join the <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.dii.univpm.it/node/391?language=en">Department of Information Engineering</a> (DII) of the same university where I graduated. They proposed me a very ambitious project in cooperation with <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.imesaspa.com/">IMESA</a>, a company producing switchgear and electrical substations for low (LV) and medium (MV) voltage solutions.
        The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance system to prevent faulty situations or outages in such electric devices. This system is conceived to process enviromental quantities of the switchgear (phase voltages, temperatures, humidity, etc.) and historical data from operative and faulty conditions in order to train a machine learning model which can detect anomalities. Therefore, at the moment I am focused on building
        a dataset containing the aforementioned quantities. Due to high costs of realization of a test bench, this issue was tackled by developing several simulation models of a MV switchgear using <a class="hl-link-work" href="https://www.comsol.com/">COMSOL Multiphysics</a>, a popular workstation to generate virtual models embedded in physical reality.
